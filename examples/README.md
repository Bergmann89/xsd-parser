This directory contains more advanced examples that show how to use `xsd-parser` for code generation during the build. For more easier examples, that cover additional features of `xsd-parser` parser, please refer to the [integrated examples](../../xsd-parser/examples/README.md).

Examples contained in this directory:

- [`read_write`](./read_write/README.md) - Generates code from a simple schema using a build script and then uses the generated code to deserialize and serialize a XML file during runtime.
- [`bpmn`](./bpmn/README.md) - Example that generates code for BPMN 2.0 and loads a diagram file.
